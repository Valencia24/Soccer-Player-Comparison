# Soccer Player Comparison

This is an interactive Flutter application that compares the two popular soccer players Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. The application consists of a
home screen that provides the user with a choice of options. Clicking the Ronaldo image takes the user to a screen that uses the Google Maps API to display
his hometown of Funchal, Portugal. Similarily, clicking the Messi image takes the user to a screen that displays his hometown of Rosario, Argentina. The
map visuals have several options that can be toggled on and off to change how the map looks such as traffic overlays and a satellite view. If the user
clicks on the trophy image, they will be taken to another screen that displays a bar chart which provides a comparison of career stats between the two
players. The bar chart is implemented using the fl_chart package.

The application was built using Android Studio, and it was visually tested on a Pixel 4 running API 33 using the Android Emulator. The lib folder contains
the four dart files used to construct the project, and each file represents a separate screen in the application.
